# licensing?

what hardware-compatible open licenses exist?

https://cern-ohl.web.cern.ch/

rough guarantees:
- right to repair
- freedom to modify / support in doing so 
- freedom to participate (i.e. no rug-pulling)
- commercialization without enshittification (i.e. guaranteed interoperability?)

Recursively? Or just for our project(s)?

...and how we don't have it

# Wishing for Context

In service of building a co-op "company" (of sorts) I go back and forth wondering what we could build, make, or what service we would provide. And I have lots of ideas but many of them feel like they've been done before and I question would what uniqueness we could bring besides "it's open hardware!" (like weather station, yet another single board computer, bike computer, etc). (Which may be a draw sometimes! But it's difficult to know when that draw would be enough to make something viable?) Or ideas I have feel hard because I lack domain knowledge or expertise in service of making/doing that thing (making an open cell phone, home Oxide rack). Or maybe ideas that are logistically complicated for a couple of friends who live 500 miles from each other (like micro power generation from wind/solar - how do you install solar panels? Can that really be DIY-able?).

Then there's this feeling of excitement and also loss when I find a cool, small product or service that seems to really be hitting some need. I think to myself, "That thing is so cool, drat! Why didn't I think of that!" For example: https://www.ecosoftenergy.com/product/ecosoft-smart-grid-controller-1/ or https://www.seedbox.systems/.

Another issue I find is that what I want is partially just driven by how work should vaguely "feel". Which is a fine thing, but not very much to go off of. Or I have many inspirations, like [Scenic Routes](https://www.scenicroutessf.com/). Scenic Routes is a bike shop where they conduct repairs but they are also a community space where they want to encourage biking for fun (motto is Slow is Forever) and engage with the public in a non-traditionally business-like way. They also allow people to have a subscription model because people want to help them be an institution in SF.

But I have trouble translating these inspirations into a specific co-op idea.

Something I was thinking about recently then, was that this is what "business people" are for I guess, right? Like, if we knew someone that could share our vision but knew how businessy things worked, and how to maybe get in touch with things people could need or want, maybe they could help understand a path through the brambles from our visions and ideas into a concrete plan.

One "Plan" I thought of was that we could, in our free time, generate a series of "products" as kits that we could sell. And we'd go for breadth, generating a new gizmo every once in a while, basically building the kit per order. And then the hope would be that we'd have thrown enough technological spaghetti at the wall that something would stick and it'd take off. But that still feels sort of unsatisfying as it's just kinda guessing that something might work maybe someday.

So, is there a way to kind of get connected to people who could perhaps help us navigate a way into a couple concrete plans? Another element to this that's in the back of my mind is that if we had a "real" plan it'd be plausible we could apply for grants or donations or investment somehow and we could pretend to sort of be a real co-op company and decide to make real by-laws and and decide to actually go for something.

Thoughts?

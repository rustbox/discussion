# How do we wrangle projects?

Things we've liked:

- Github Project Board w/ Swimlanes
- Periodic review rituals
- Phases to communicate what the "next step" is (e.g. "waiting for QA" / "blocked on review")
- Broad definitions ("epic") vs. specific tasks ("issues")
- Lots of little incremental steps
- Sharing progress & excitement & mutual interest

Things that haven't gone so hot:

- Having a consistent "direction" to the incremental steps
- Documenting the "why" and "how" of a thing
- Deciding _when_ to revisit & review & design certain topics
- Scheduling & planning on retrospectives
- Depth-first vs. breadth-first searching ðŸ™ƒ

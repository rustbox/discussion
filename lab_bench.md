# Electronics Lab Bench

Collecting details about our lab bench setup, and discussion about what to aim for next.

## Current

* [Diligent Digital Discovery](https://digilent.com/shop/digital-discovery-portable-usb-logic-analyzer-and-digital-pattern-generator/) (with high speed adapter)
  * Seth: I also got a bunch of extra flywires (for the [sides](https://digilent.com/shop/2x6-flywires-signal-cable-assembly-for-the-digital-discovery/) and [front](https://digilent.com/shop/2x16-flywires-signal-cable-assembly-for-the-digital-discovery/)), so it's possible to leave the "loose" end connected to a project and swap just the analyzer side.
* Eric: Soldering station w/ hot air rework gun (link?)
  * Seth: we don't talk about my soldering setup. It's no good.
* Eric: Hot plate

We also both have a "wire cart" to try and keep things collected/organized.

## Previously

Seth: I got some equipment loaned to me as part of the courses I took at my local community college:

* Siglent SDS 1202X-E Oscilloscope
* Siglen SDG 810 Function/Arbitrary Waveform Generator
* TackLife MDC01 DC Power Supply (can't recommend)

# Next?

Here's a wishlist:

- Power profiler (maybe https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/Power-Profiler-Kit-2 ?)
- FPGA development kit (maybe https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty-a7/start ?)
- FPGA accelerator (something from https://rhsresearch.com/collections/rhs-public ?)
- Something halfway between an oscilloscope and the digial discovery mebe? (Diligent's "analog discovery" line?)

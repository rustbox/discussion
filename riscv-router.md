#  risc-v router

Selling a low-cost, low-power, small (2-6 port) gigabit router that's easy to hack on the software & hardware.

# software

Bare metal vs. full linux distro ? 

Bare metal: high efficiency, tight integration, few use-cases
Full linux: still need drivers, massive (unaccelerated) ecosystem

Evaluation criteria:
- Boot time 
- Power efficiency
- Update/modification tooling

testing: RTL simulator vs virtualized ? Possible to mix the two?

# RTL model

chipyard/firesim includes icenet

# PCB design / validation

How many layers?

Trace sensitivity at 1 gigabit? (i.e. what happens when we double the number of ports?)

How do we measure things at 1 gigabit?

# part selection / pricing

https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/arty.html ?

Xilinx Spartan 7? (in the logic analyzer) 

ethernet PHY on-FPGA or off-FPGA?

# compliance

## being compliant

what are the emissions limits for RF emissions from "unintentional emitter" digital devices?
What changes between regions? FCC vs. "EU" vs. "Asia"?

testing harnesses? home anechoic chambers?

## demonstrating compliance

booking (expensive) time at a "proving" lab?

# TBD

- manufacturability
- sales / fulfillment
- operations / legal
